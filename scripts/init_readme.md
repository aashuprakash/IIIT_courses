The repository contains resources for IIITD courses. You can access the resources using the [website](https://aflah02.github.io/SemWiseResourcesIIIT/) or the README.md file.

- If you want to add resources but are confused about how to start, please refer to this [guide](https://aflah02.github.io/SemWiseResourcesIIIT/CONTRIBUTING)
- Course books for courses can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Xhwlwbhj1HP6R9BysSoXcqScWFsnIj7B)


> Note: The process has recently changed (December 2023) and the changes now need to go to `resources.yaml` and not to `README.md` directly
